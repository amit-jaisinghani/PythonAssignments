Test case 1:
This case is general case which checks graph is building properly and whether starting paint ball with max color is
correct one. And check cows that were painted by best paint ball and colors they were painted with.
Expected output:
Field of Dreams
---------------
BLUE connectedTo: ['Daisy', 'GREEN', 'Babe', 'RED', 'Fauntleroy']
Daisy connectedTo: []
GREEN connectedTo: ['Daisy']
Babe connectedTo: []
RED connectedTo: ['Fauntleroy', 'Milka']
Fauntleroy connectedTo: []
Milka connectedTo: []

Beginning simulation...
Triggering  BLUE  paint ball...
Daisy is painted BLUE!
GREEN paint ball is triggered by BLUE paint ball
Daisy is painted GREEN!
Babe is painted BLUE!
RED paint ball is triggered by BLUE paint ball
Fauntleroy is painted RED!
Milka is painted RED!
Fauntleroy is painted BLUE!
Triggering  GREEN  paint ball...
Daisy is painted GREEN!
Triggering  RED  paint ball...
Fauntleroy is painted RED!
Milka is painted RED!

Results:
Triggering the BLUE paint ball is the best choice with 6 total points on the cows:
Daisy ['BLUE', 'GREEN']
Babe ['BLUE']
Fauntleroy ['RED', 'BLUE']
Milka ['RED']

Output is per expectation.


Test case 2:
This case for infinite loop. 3 paint balls - RED, GREEN, BLUE are in each other's blast radius. Here we will check
if paint balls triggering logic is going in infinite loop or not.
Result: Infinite loop is avoided. Output is as expected.


Test case 3:
This case checks if all cows are out of blast radius.
Result:
As expected, no cows were painted.
